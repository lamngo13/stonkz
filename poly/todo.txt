I'm working on getting more and better data

grand structure.
autofiller()
this gets new data
investigation()
this adds new data to my db
fixer_of_bad()
rn, this fixes previous close
it ALSO needs to average out values that 
are called BAD 
I plan to do that by loading a column into a dataframe and 
then using one of their averaging functions

AFTER that
I prob want to use a LTSM or maybe
continue using the XGBoost ai stuff
where I have written in aifunctions.py
ALSO I might be able to average their predictions, who knows lol
