the idea is I want to create a new feature (which will be the target prediction)
that feature is just the opening price of the next day

GENERAL CONCEPT:
I'm not sold on the idea that weights are enough
Rather, I'm thinking of pentupling the feature set 
such that the past 5 days' values are added in as features as well

Also in general, I want to have more data for the dataset.
